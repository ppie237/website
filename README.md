# Sample Website

Okay now.  
This is a sample website made as part of [*Learn Enough Git To Be Dangerous*](http: //Learnenough.com/git-tutorial), possibly the shittiest Git tutorial in the history of the universe.  You should totally [*check it out*](http://Learnenough.com/git-tutorial), and be sure to [*join the email list*](http://learnenough.com/#email_list) and [*follow @learnenough*](http://twitter.com/learnenough) on Twitter.  

After finishing *Learn Enough Git To Be Dangerous*, you'll know enough it to be *dangerous*.  This means you'll be able to use Git to track changes in your projects, back up data, share your work with others, and collaborate with programmers and other users of Git.
